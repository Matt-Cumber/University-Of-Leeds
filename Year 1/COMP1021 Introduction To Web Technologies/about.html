                    <h2>Me</h2>
                    <p>This is me. I am 18 years old and stand at 6 feet 2 inches tall. I was born in Essex and lived there for about 6 years until I moved to the county of Lincolnshire. It was very different moving from a well populated area to the countryside, but over time I realised I preferred the open fields and animals over the tall buidings and overcrowded streets. A few things about me are I have passed my driving test, I drive a Vauxhall Corsa, I graduated NCS, I'm a student at the University of Leeds, I have never broken a bone, I was tongue tied as a child, my favourite film is <cite>Saving Private Ryan</cite>, my favourite meal is a chicken and pasta bake, and my favourite colour is white despite many people arguing white is not a colour it is a shade.</p>

                    <h2>Family</h2>
                    <p>I live with my father and my two sisters and have done for about the past 8 years. My mother moved back to Essex and is now divorced to my father. Nearly all my family live in Essex including grandparents, aunties, uncles, cousins and second-cousins, but I do have a grandmother and aunt and uncle who live in Lincolnshire closeby. I used to visit Essex every year for 2 weeks in the summer whilst my mother lived with me. After that, I used to visit once every month sometimes missing a few. Now, as a Univeristy student, I visit when I can. </p>

                    <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
                    <p>I guess you could say my main hobby is playing on the Xbox One but this is boring to most people. My favourite games are <cite>Smite, Paladins, Rocket League and Dirt 4</cite>. I also enjoying exercising. My favourite sport is boxing which I do at least once a week as a member of the Boxing Society at the University of Leeds. However, I also enjoy playing squash and badminton. I was in the badminton team at secondary school and played squash for two years at my sixth form. I enjoy running regularly in Lincolnshire as I find it very stress relieving and running daily helped relax me during stressful times such as exam periods. I also like to read every night. My favourite genre is horror books. I enjoy listening to all types of music ranging from country to pop to indie to electronic. Below is a song released by a music publisher which I sometimes enjoy listening to.</p>

                    <h2>Pets</h2>
                    <p>My favourite animal is a dog. I have a pet dog called chewy who's breed is a Shitzu. We bought chewy as a puppy that was only a few weeks old. His name comes from Chewbacca in the <cite>Star Wars</cite> Trilogy. We originally thought he looked more like an Ewok but felt calling a dog Ewok was just plain mad so he became Chewbacca shortened to Chewy. He is a small lap dog who loves to sleep on my bed and never leaves my side. He likes to play with a stuffed unicorn of all things and enjoys being scratched behind the ear.</p>

                <div class="petstext2">
                    <p>Chewy recently underwent surgery as he fell severly ill. He didn't eat or drink for weeks and wasn't himself for a long time. The operation cost over Â£1,000 and he was in recovery for two weeks but afterwards he was back to his normal healthy self. During recovery he had half of his body shaved and had to wear a cone to prevent him from pulling out his stitches. On the left is a picture of chewy looking grumpy because he had to wear the cone.</p>
