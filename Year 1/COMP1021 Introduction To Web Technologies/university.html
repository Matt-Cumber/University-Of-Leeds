            <h2>Why University?</h2>
            <p>I never thought University would be something for me. It was never spoken about within my family as no one has ever been to university before. I was always better at the science subjects as opposed to sports and english or drama. I really enjoyed Design Technology at school and my initial plan was to persue a career in car mechanics, carpentry or metal working. However, despite being goood at the coursework and making the products, I was never good at exams in these subjects but always succeded in maths and science. The major factor in me taking A levels then finally going to University is due to my grandfather who always wanted what was best for me and told me to live the dream and not worry about staying close to home and being near family. He told me to work hard get good grades and secure a job with a good pay. And so that's what I tried to do.</p>

            <h2>Before University</h2>
            <p>The next step to getting to the goal of University was making sure I knew what I wante to take. It was a debate bewteen Accountancy, Maths and Computer Science. I have always enjoyed maths but struggled to see the future job applications of a maths degree so that rules that out for me. Next was Accountancy. I thought this would be good as from researching online it seemed to be a good pay but friends and teachers convinced me I would not be fully engaged with my job as an accountant. So I chose computer science. I have always been intrigued by the thought of programming and producing applocations such as games and robots. The next step was trying to get into University.</p>

            <p> Once I had chosen the course I needed to choose right A levels to meet the entry requirements for the course. To get into Univeristy I took 4 A levels at the sixth form of a grammar school nearby to home. Here they helped me achieve my best helped me through the whole application process. I applied to Leeds, Nottingham, Bristol, Southhampton and Loughborough. I recieved an offer from all these Universities and went to visit them all. After all their respective open days, I had fallen in love with Leeds. I felt most comfortable going there. I needed to obtain three A's to be accepted into Leeds and a table of my final A level reults can be seen to the left. As you can see, I succeeded in and got into University.</p>

            <h2>Life at University</h2>
            <p>Adjusting to University life has been difficult. Coming back to a city and well populate area has been tough. As simple as it sounds the noise from outside can sometimes prevent me from sleeping as I'm used to almost complete silence if you include animal sounds from surrounding farms. I have enjoyed living independently. It is nice to always have space to myself as living with two sisters has restricted privacy a little. I do miss them and I especially miss Chewy but University was definitely the right choice for me. The work load can often be overwhelming but with good time management it soon becomes less of a problem. I would like to take a year out in industry between my third and fourth year so that I can come back to University and obtain my masters.</p>
