            <h2>Meeting Lucy</h2>
            <p>I met Lucy on the 25<sup>th</sup> of July 2016 during NCS. From the first time we met we became inseperable almost instantly. We spent all of summer 2016 together doing all sorts activites together ranging from 6 mile hikes, abseiling and shooting arrows with bows, to gardening, selling cakes and packing bags in Iceland. It was one of the best summers all thanks to her. We carried on messaging until our NCS graduation on the 1<sup>st</sup> of September where it could have been our final time seeing each other. However, we both decided to meet after at a future date in a local Costa. We met several times before we finally became offcial.</p>

            <h2>Dating Lucy</h2>
            <p>Lucy and I became official on the 28<sup>th</sup> of September 2016 and have now been together for almost a year and a half. During this time we've been on several dates and below are some pictures of us together. Lucy is very caring, she helped me achieve focus on work when I needed to most and she always buys thoughtful gifts. She is very inteligent and is extremely funny never failing to make me laugh. Her family have been very welcoming and her mother invites me round every sunday to have a roast dinner for lunch with them. Dating Lucy has been the best experience of my life and I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next for us.</p>
