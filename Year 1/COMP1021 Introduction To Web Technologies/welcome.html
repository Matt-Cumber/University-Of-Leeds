            <p>Welcome to my website. It has been designed and created for the purpose of being submitted as coursework 1 for the discovery module "Introduction to Web Technologies" at the Univeristy of Leeds. The content of the webiste is not that interesting and the main focus is on the design and layout of the pages but feel free to read the text if you wish. The website makes use of the ability to hover over elements to result in a change so make sure to hover over everything as it just might change slightly like this text. The website is based primarily around me with the exception of including my girlfriend but she was happy to be included in it. The About page tells you more about me, who I am as a person as well as some totally useless facts that I've added. The Geneva tab focuses on a school trip which I went on in 2016 as part of A level Physics which turned out not to be as educational as first thought to be. Next, the My Girlfriend page tells you a little bit about how we met and what it's been like to have a girlfriend. And finally, the University page tells you a bit about what it's been like for me so far as a student at the university. Feel free to look around the site.</p>
