  <h1>What is a computer?</h1>
  <p>by Matthew Cumber</p>
  <p class="one">What is a computer? A question which may come across as simple at first sight but has no definitive answer. If you were to search, “Define computer”, in Google you would be presented with the following, “an electronic device which is capable of receiving information (data) in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions (program) to produce a result in the form of information or signals.” This has been taken from [Oxford Dictionaries]. However, if you were to view the answer on other websites, the answer will be comparatively different. Similarly, asking someone what is a computer, usually they will have difficulty explaining the answer and no answer will be the same. This presents an arguable answer for a seemingly simple question. Below I will go into further detail into what I believe a computer is and what they are used for.
<br>
      <figure class="BOMBE">
        <img src="http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/bombe/img/bombe_replica_full.jpg" alt="BOMBE"
             width="228" height="144">

        </figure>
Let’s begin with the first modern computer. This computer as such was named BOMBE and was initially designed by Alan Turing in 1939. This computer was used during World War II to aid the British in shortening the war by cracking the enigma code used by the Germans [Crypto Museum]. Since then computers have greatly advanced and we have built millions of computers which connect over thousands of networks world wide. Computers in today’s world range from super computers and mainframes to our personal computers (PC’s) we often take for granted. Beginning with supercomputers, these are computers which manipulate data in a complex way as fast as possible, whereas mainframes manipulate very large volumes of data in a reliable way. Both super computers and mainframes push the capabilities of modern computers to new limits [Hughes, C]. Looking at PC’s, these are computers like those we use at home for simple tasks such as writing an email or playing video games. This means they do not require a great amount of processing power relative to a supercomputer or mainframe and are considered to be single-user systems with microprocessors [Beal, V]. 
<br>
<br>
Computers are all linked by the hardware behind them which includes motherboards, data storage and other various hardware. By considering the hardware of computers, it is arguable that other devices for example games consoles and even mobile phones can be considered to be computers. In today’s world, games consoles and mobile phones can be used to access the internet, play games and communicate globally, all of which are applications of a computer. This may lead to the conclusion that these devices are in fact computers but not everyone believes this to be the case. However, in my opinion, these devices including mobile phones are computers in their own right as they consist of the similar hardware evident in our PC’s.

      <figure class="CLI">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Linux_command-line._Bash._GNOME_Terminal._screenshot.png" alt="Image of a CLI"
            width="228" height="144">
          <figcaption>Fig2. - Image of a CLI [Wikipedia]</figcaption>
      </figure>
<br>
All this hardware is great, but without an operating system a computer cannot function. An operating system is, “software that manages computer hardware and software. It supplies an interface for the user and important utilities for managing the computer,” [BBC Bitesize]. The operating system is what makes computers useable for most users. It provides the interface for the user allowing them to interact with the computer in a relatively easy way depending on skill level and the type of operating system. Examples of operating systems include Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Windows or Mac OS X is what most users use on their home PC as these operating systems provide a graphical user interface (GUI) which is considered to be the most user friendly and easy to use interface. This is because it consists of menus, icons, a pointer and other graphic images all of which you may be seeing on your screen now. This makes a GUI great for all types of users with a variety of different skill levels and it allows us to use the computer with relative ease for a wide range of tasks. However, a GUI may not be applicable in all cases, for example a GUI would not be suitable on a low power computer as showing all the graphics requires a lot of processing power. Another interface which is often provided by Linux is a command line interface (CLI). This consists of a simple input output by where the user types in commands which are then processed and carried out. This is a very difficult interface to use as it provides limited help and the commands need to be precise. This means generally only experts use this interface as it is quicker to use than a GUI with the correct level of knowledge. CLI’s were all that were used in the early days of computers as we did not have the processing power to run a GUI [Copley, S]. As well as providing the human computer interaction, the operating system also manages the CPU, memory and all the peripherals and performs more background tasks without the user realising [BBC Bitesize]. 
<br>
<br>
Computers are behind everything. They are applicable in most circumstances. However, it is not possible to have one computer suitable for all tasks so computers are made with varying components of hardware with different software and operating systems. Mainframes are likely to be used when transactions are involved as this is a repetitive process which deals with large volumes of data and needs to be 100% accurate, for example when purchasing flight tickets [IBMMainframes]. Super computers on the other hand are more suited to complex problems such as recreating brains or the nervous system to aid in scientific research. This is because they have the processing power to do this unlike all other computers [Pappas, S].
<br>
<br>
Computers all need a set of instructions to function. Without them, they are just pieces of hardware all connected without a purpose. Programs or scripts are developed by programmers for the computer to read and run accordingly. These scripts and programs are written in a programming language which is, “a special language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute” [Computer Hope]. There are many different programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, Haskell, all of which have a variety of applications. Not all languages are suitable for the same task, for example, to program a game, typically C++ or Java would be used where as to program artificial intelligence Python or C might be used [Computer Hope, a]. Needless to say there are many languages some which cross over and have multiple uses, others which are designed for a specific task. Amongst the many languages, high level programming languages can be identified like Java or C++. These programming languages have developed to a point where they are more human like and can be used for many tasks [Computer Hope, b].
<br>
<br>
So, what is a computer? To me a computer is a platform we all use to make our lives easier on a day to day basis. It is, at its core, hardware and software combined with programs to make a highly complex machine that can be used for the most complicated of tasks and even the most simple of tasks. Without our computers, we would be living in a very different world without mobile phones, without the internet, without social media, and we would be living in a dark age for technology. We have become dependent on computers for all our needs and wants in which we would be lost just from the thought of not having computers in our society.

  <h1>Simple Code</h1>
  <p class="one">Below is two examples of how to use a high level progarmming language to print text onto the screen. In the first case using the language Python, the words "Hello World" are printed to the screen when a user runs the script. The second case uses the language Java to print to the screen the words "Goodbye World" when the user runs the script.</p>
  <h2>Python</h2>
    <div class="code">
  <p>print("Hello World")</p>
